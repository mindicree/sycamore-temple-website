          <p>&emsp; &emsp; Pastor Samuel L. Payne Jr.,
has enjoyed the privilege of residency in the beautiful mountains of Asheville, North Carolina.
He is the second of three siblings. Pastor Payne was offered the mantel of Pastorship following
the demise of his great father Supt. Samuel Louis Payne Sr., and for over 30 years he continues
to be the enthusiastic Pastor of Sycamore Temple Church of God In Christ with a testimony that
he is saved, sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost and do speak in tongues as the Spirit gives
utterance. He is not just a man taking a walk, but he is a man of distinction, moral integrity,
and high principles. As a result, in 2014 he was appointed Superintendent of the Land of the

Superintendent Payne is endeavoring to strengthen the body of Christ to a greater level of
growth and commitment.<br>&emsp; &emsp;

Pastor Payne attended AB Tech and trained in Auto Mechanics. Before graduating, he was

the military, Pastor Payne attended Cecil Business College. Pastor Payne retired from Carolina
Power &amp; Light Company (CP&amp;L) in 1993 after 20 years and became full-time in the Ministry.
This accomplishment has afforded him great opportunities throughout Greater North Carolina
and other parts of the United States. Under his tutelage as Pastor, Sycamore Temple would
successfully feeds anywhere from 20-50 homeless persons per Sunday. Pastor Payne served as
CEO of Grace Community Development, a program under the umbrella of Sycamore Temple
COGIC which consisted of an abstinence Program, an after school program, and a literacy
program. Pastor Payne stands tall in the community and well respected throughout the college
of Pastors in Asheville.<br>&emsp; &emsp;

Pastor Payne is truly a family man. His marriage to the late Barbara Gordon-Payne was one of
great accomplishment. He is the proud father of 3 daughters: Nikkia Payne-McBath, Nicole
Payne-Wright and Natosha Payne. He is the proud grandfather (Pop-pee) of 5 wonderful
grandkids: Skyrah, Tice, Anthony, Gary, Victoria and April.<br>&emsp; &emsp;

He is now married to Lady Janice Marie Payne. Together they are striving to Lead the Body of
Christ at Sycamore Temple to higher heights and seeking to motivate the members to always
pursue HOLY and RIGHTEOUS living. During times of uncertainty, Pastor Payne alone with
Sycamore Temple’s Prayer Team incorporates 14+ hours of weekly prayer assembly.
Pastor Payne is truly a man after God’s own heart.</p>
