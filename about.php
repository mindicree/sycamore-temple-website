            <h2>Our History</h2>

            <p>
              &emsp; &emsp;Sycamore Temple was the church organized under the Church of God in Christ in Western North Carolina in the mid-1930s. The church begin in the living room of Mother Selima H. Cannon. At that time, the churches did not have names: rather, the churches were numbered and Sycamore Temple was Church Number 3. In 1937, Elder J.C. Griffin, along with approximately 30 members, was blessed to purchase an edifice for worship. By the Grace of God, they were blessed and able to buy a site on Sycamore Hill, later known as Beaumont Street”. Because of the redevelopment in the Market/Eagle Street area, this street no longer exists.
              <br>&emsp; &emsp;During the depression, the cost of the church was $1,000 with a down payment of $1,000 and a monthly payment of $10 per month. The initial fundraises was a revival and by God’s Grace $50 was raised for the down payment and the remaining down payment was paid within 30 days. Their dreams became reality, as their prayers were answered. “Number # 3” was the first sanctuary to be incorporated under the Church of God in Christ in Western North Carolina. The incorporation was later dropped and our church was renamed Sycamore Temple Church of God in Christ. It was also known as “The Little Church under the Hill”.
              <br>&emsp; &emsp;Elder Griffin remained pastor until 1939. Elder Boone succeeded him and remained pastor until 1944. In 1944, Bishop Wyoming Wells appointed Elder Samuel L. Payne, Sr. as pastor. At the time the church had 50 members. With sacrifices, prayer, and God’s blessings, the church’s mortgage was paid off in its entirety on June 2, 1954.
              <br>&emsp; &emsp;The membership continued to grow and in 1970, Elder Payne, Sr. became interested in purchasing another place for worship. Mother Margaret Payne, his wife, learned from an advertisement that the Nazarene Church in Downtown Asheville was for sale. However, the new location for the Nazarene Church had not been built and would take two years to complete. This was a blessing, because it gave Sycamore Temple’s congregation the opportunity to the raise monies necessary to purchase the church at a cost of $55,000. During those times, that seemed to be as astronomical sum, but Elder Payne Sr. always reminded the members that “Our Father is Rich and He will supply our every need”. They worked, prayed, and kept the faith. In April 1972. The congregation marched into their new church home, here at 11 North Ann Street. The church was given 25 years to pay the balance of the mortgage. By the dedication work of the saints and the Grace of God, the mortgage was paid in full within eight years.
              <br>&emsp; &emsp;In July of 1985, Bishop L.B. Davenport appointed Elder Samuel L. Payne, Jr. as the pastor of Sycamore Temple to succeed his late father, Superintendent Samuel L. Payne, Sr. Under the leadership of Superintendent Samuel L. Payne, Jr. the membership has increased more than four-folds. The church was reincorporated in 2002. We are in a building fund project and look forward to renovating and expanding our place of worship. Many other blessings have been bestowed upon the leaders of this church. In March 1987, Missionary Barbara G. Payne was appointed District Missionary of the Asheville District, and in 1992, she was appointed the Assistant to the Jurisdictional Supervisor and worked faithfully until her death.
              <br>&emsp; &emsp;In August 1995, Elder Payne was selected Administrative Assistant to the Bishop of Greater North Carolina. On July 22, 2014, Elder Payne was appointed Superintendent of the Asheville District, renamed Land of the Sky Asheville District. One year later, on July 22, 2015, God sent him a lovely and gifted helpmate; Janice Marie Payne. Today there are still descendants (children) of the original members actively working and supporting the ministry at the present day Sycamore Temple. God has blessed many families in His service who came from “Under the Hill” to “Over the Hill”.
